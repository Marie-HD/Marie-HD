- 👋 Hi, I’m @Marie-HD. I contacted the team around 1.5 weeks ago. Sonia and Paul answered me and suggested I present myself here. Thanks guys!
- 👀 I’m a scientist in ifeu in Heidelberg Germany in the mobility team (https://www.ifeu.de/themen/mobilitaet/).
- 🌱 I’m currently working on the calculation of the GHG and pollutant emissions of the transport sector in Germany for the environmental  agency (UBA). We have a tool called TREMOD to calculate transport emissions, activity we have been doing for the last 25 years (https://www.ifeu.de/en/project/uba-tremod-2019/) and we developed two simpler tools for developing countries for the GIZ (https://www.giz.de/de/html/index.html) and other developing agencies. one is called TRIGGER (https://changing-transport.org/tool/trigger/), it is done for inventories of all sectors and the second is called MYC (Mobiliseyourcity) emission calculator (https://www.mobiliseyourcity.net/mobiliseyourcity-emissions-calculator) , which delivers also inventory of GHG emissions for road and rail but also scenarios both for national and local levels.
I am also working on a prototype for a transport database with the GIZ, which should be presented in Mai/April this year for a design thinking process
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all issues linked with transport and the environment, data, open source, worldwide
